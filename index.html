        <p>
            I am a graduate of York University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have a passion for developing new skills and growing myself as an individual.
            <br> 
            <br>
            My interest ranges from technology, entrepreneurship, education, startups to social media, communications & digital marketing. I thrive off being challenged by new experiences and put out of my comfort zone.
            
            <br> 
            <br>
            Aside from work you can find me at the gym, drawing, doing some light reading or having some coffee, and vibing to music enjoying the sunshine.
